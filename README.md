<h3>Steps Involved</h3>

<h4>1. Data Preprocessing:</h4>
Handling null values and outliers
Feature scaling and normalization
Splitting the data into training and testing sets

<h4>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h4>  
Visualizing trends and patterns in the data
Correlation analysis
<h4>3. Feature Engineering:</h4>
Creating new features based on existing data
Selecting the most relevant features for the model

<h4>4. Model Selection:</h4>  
Random Forest Model selected

<h4>5. Model Training and Testing:</h4>
Training the model on the training set
Evaluating the model on the testing set
Avoiding overfitting and bias

<h4>6. Deployment:</h4>
Saving the trained model
Creating a user-friendly interface for predictions

<h4>7. Results </h4>
The model’s performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
Visualizations of the predicted vs. actual prices

<h4>8. Future Work</h4>
