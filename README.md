Bitcoin Price Predictor
Project Overview
This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data from 2018 to 2024. The model is built and trained using Google Colab.

Dataset
Name: BITCOIN Historical Datasets 2018-2024
Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains daily historical data of Bitcoin prices, including columns such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and more.
Tools and Libraries
Google Colab: For running the model
Python: Programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computing
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework

Steps Involved

Data Preprocessing:
Handling null values and outliers
Feature scaling and normalization
Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing trends and patterns in the data
Correlation analysis
Feature Engineering:
Creating new features based on existing data
Selecting the most relevant features for the model

Model Selection:
Trying different models (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.)
Hyperparameter tuning
Model Training and Testing:
Training the model on the training set
Evaluating the model on the testing set
Avoiding overfitting and bias

Deployment:
Saving the trained model
Creating a user-friendly interface for predictions
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository.
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
Open the project in Google Colab.
Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

Results
The model’s performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
Visualizations of the predicted vs. actual prices

Future Work
Improving the model’s accuracy
Adding more features
Exploring other machine learning algorithms
