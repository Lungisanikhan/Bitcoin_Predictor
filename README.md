<h1>Bitcoin Price Predictor</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<b>Objective:</b> This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data from 2018 to 2024. The model is built and trained using Google Colab.

Dataset
Name: BITCOIN Historical Datasets 2018-2024
Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains daily historical data of Bitcoin prices, including columns such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and more.
Tools and Libraries
Google Colab: For running the model
Python: Programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computing
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework

<h3>Steps Involved</h3>

<h4>1. Data Preprocessing:</h4>
Handling null values and outliers
Feature scaling and normalization
Splitting the data into training and testing sets

<h4>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h4>  
Visualizing trends and patterns in the data
Correlation analysis
Feature Engineering:
Creating new features based on existing data
Selecting the most relevant features for the model

<h4>3. Model Selection:</h4>  
Trying different models (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.)
Hyperparameter tuning

<h4>4. Model Training and Testing:</h4>
Training the model on the training set
Evaluating the model on the testing set
Avoiding overfitting and bias

<h4>5. Deployment:</h4>
Saving the trained model
Creating a user-friendly interface for predictions

<h4>6. Results </h4>
The model’s performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
Visualizations of the predicted vs. actual prices

<h3>How to Run the Project</h3>
